Lane 1 starts the event message then the condition lane 1 parallels the gateway divergence is checked. If the answer is null then user task 5 then the condition exclusive gateway divergence 2 is checked if the answer is null then lane 2 services the task 7 then exclusive gateway convergence 2
if the answer is null then collapsed sub-process, sub process - expanded then exclusive gateway convergence 2
then end event terminate.
If the answer is null then the condition exclusive gateway divergence 1 is checked if the answer is null then lane 1 calls the activity calling a global task then exclusive gateway convergence 1
if the answer is null then call activity collapsed, call activity - expanded then exclusive gateway convergence 1
then lane 1 ends the event message.
