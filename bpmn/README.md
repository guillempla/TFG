# BPMN Models

In this folder there are some folders containing **BPMN** models extracted from the [bpmn-miwg.test-suite](https://github.com/bpmn-miwg/bpmn-miwg-test-suite) Github's repository. There is a total of 16 models. All of them had been extracted from the Reference folder. 

Each folder contains a model `.bpmn` and some `.png` images showing a diagram of the model. All `.pdf` diagrams had been removed because they are not necessary as we have the images, also we don't have a `.pdf` for every model.

This models will be used for creating the dataset of **BPMN** models and it's corresponding **Description in Natural Language**. As we don't have many of them, we should modify them to achive more data.
